### **Email 3: Educational - Strategy Deep Dive** (7 days)

**Subject**: Deep Dive: Understanding NQ Momentum Alpha

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

Let's dive deep into one of our most popular strategies: NQ Momentum Alpha.

WHAT IT DOES:

NQ Momentum Alpha is designed for the first 90 minutes of US market hours (9:30-11:00 ET), when volume and volatility are highest.

WHY THIS SESSION?

The market open often sees strong directional moves as:
• Overnight news gets priced in
• Institutional orders hit the market
• Retail traders enter positions
• High volume creates momentum

METHODOLOGY:

The strategy looks for:
1. Directional momentum confirmation
2. Volume expansion
3. Specific entry criteria based on 15 years of data
4. Clear exit signals for risk management

WHEN TO USE IT:

✓ High-volume market opens
✓ Clear directional bias
✓ Trending market conditions

WHEN TO AVOID:

✗ Low-volume holidays
✗ Major news events (Fed, NFP)
✗ Choppy, range-bound opens

NEXT WEEK:

We'll cover NQ Trend Rider and how it complements Momentum Alpha.

Happy trading!
